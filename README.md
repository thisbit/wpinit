# wpinit
This is a wordpress install script I use to automate wp setup on my machines

## What does it do?
* It downloads latest WP
* It removes stock themes and plugins but leaves index.php files in themes and plugins folder
* It installs wprig "theme"
* It installs migrate db, classic editor and show current template which I alsways install
* it puts htaccess, robots and humans files in wordpress root

## Also
* I plan to add the database creation in this script as well as seting up wprig dependencies automatically
* I made this for my own use ... so use if you like ... but thats it
* Run as sudo if your sever root is outside of your home folder
* On location promt enter dot if you want to install in current directory
* Remove, change or add anything you like
